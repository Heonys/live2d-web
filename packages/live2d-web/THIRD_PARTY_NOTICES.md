  adds per-WebGL-context shader/offscreen cleanup required by Stage disposal.

## Cubism Web Framework modification record

Behavioral modifications are limited to:

- `src/rendering/cubismshader_webgl.ts`: Promise-based shader readiness,
  bundled-source support, explicit HTTP/empty/compile/link failures and
  per-context release. Blend-mode shader programs are generated only for
  models that report blend-mode usage (with incremental registration and an
  explicit error guard if a blend program is requested but absent), program
  binds go through a redundancy-checked `setProgram()` helper, and static
  drawable index/UV data binds cached buffers instead of re-uploading each
  draw call (this also removes a duplicated UV upload in the mask path).
- `src/rendering/cubismrenderer_webgl.ts`: await shader readiness, inject
  bundled sources, release renderer-owned WebGL resources and reuse the
  adapter-provided framebuffer/viewport instead of synchronous per-frame
  WebGL state queries. Drawing also skips the original fire-and-forget shader
  readiness check because adapter model initialization already awaited it.
  Adds per-drawable static index/UV buffer caches and a reusable render-target
  quad index buffer (all released with the renderer), drops per-draw
  `useProgram(null)` resets in favor of the shader-side program cache, and
  tracks whether `setRenderState()` reported the bound framebuffer so mask
  setup can skip its per-frame synchronous framebuffer query.
- `src/rendering/cubismrendertarget_webgl.ts`: `beginDraw()` and `copyBuffer()`
  accept an optional flag stating that the restore framebuffer is known, which
  skips the synchronous `gl.getParameter(FRAMEBUFFER_BINDING)` pipeline stall;
  default behavior without the flag is unchanged.
- `src/rendering/cubismrenderer.ts`: `getModelColor()` and
  `getModelColorWithOpacity()` return reused scratch color instances instead of
  allocating via a JSON round trip on every draw call; values are unchanged.
- `src/rendering/cubismoffscreenmanager.ts`: release offscreen targets owned by
  a disposed Stage.
- `src/physics/cubismphysics.ts`: write physics output directly to its target
  parameter instead of allocating and copying the unchanged tail of the
  parameter array for every output on every physics tick. Per-sub-rig
  input/output/particle views are cached once after parsing instead of sliced
  again during every evaluation.

Several Framework files also use TypeScript `import type` declarations so the
vendored source can be bundled under `verbatimModuleSyntax`. These changes do
not alter Framework runtime behavior. Project-owned `core-compat.d.ts` contains
only the minimal ambient Core surface required to typecheck the Framework; the
official Core implementation and official Core type file are not included.
